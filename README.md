## Limitations

The API has some unexpected behaviour when fetching non-premium user's data. Sometimes their data will be fetched and displayed on the website, but sometimes it will give an constant error no matter how many times the website is refreshed. This behaviour does not occur for premium users.

Non-premium users cannot use the Player due to Spotify's restrictions.

Any logged in user, whether their data is fetched or not, will be able to browse for albums, search for artists, songs, and playlists.
